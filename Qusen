1. Difference between getElementById and querySelector?

getElementById selects a single element using its id.
getElementsByClassName selects multiple elements using class name.
querySelector selects the first matching CSS selector.
querySelectorAll selects all matching elements and returns a NodeList.

2. How to create and insert element?

We use document.createElement() to create a new element.
Then we can use appendChild() or append() to insert it into the DOM.

3. What is Event Bubbling?

Event Bubbling is when an event starts from the target element and then moves upward to its parent elements.

4. What is Event Delegation?

Event Delegation means adding an event listener to a parent element instead of multiple child elements.
It improves performance and works for dynamically added elements.

5. preventDefault vs stopPropagation?

preventDefault() stops the default browser behavior.
stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling to parent elements.
